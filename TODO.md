- finish EDA:
    - Development of Net Load and Residual Load
    - Correlation of Features
    - Outliers in Electricity Prices
- test if handling outliers makes model prediction better
- test if dummy variale "new_price_zone" makes prediction better. If yes, keep it, else remove
- do data cleanup (handle missing values and maybe even data plateaus?)
- After Training: print out the feature importance
- Make sure that the model does not use data that it shouldn't know -> it maybe does in floating avg / std / negative price / "price" / "price_eur_per_mwh"
- make predictions for specific timestamps (for example any random date or any specific geopolitical date)
- adjust README.md
- maybe train more models?
