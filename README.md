# <font color="SlateBlue">EPEX Electricity Price Forecasting</font>

This university project focuses on predicting the **German EPEX Spot electricity prices** on an hourly basis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The main goal is to build a regression model that can predict these electricity prices based on historical data ranging from January 2015 to the end of December 2024. 

The notebook follows a **typical machine learning workflow** and common best practices. Each individual step is thoroughly documented by markdown cells and comments in code. Relevant technical terms are explained where necessary to ensure a clear understanding of each process. A dedicated **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) provides deeper insights into the German electricity market in order to gain a sufficient amount of domain knowledge for later feature selection.

We will train a single **`XGBoost` regression model** and evaluate it using key metrics like RMSE, MAE and the RÂ² Score. The notebook concludes with a summary of the project and a discussion of several potential improvements.

## <font color="SlateBlue">How to Use</font>

**Clone the repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DanielHka25/electricity-price-prediction.git
  cd electricity-price-prediction
  ```
**Installation of required libraries (using a Python virtual environment)**
1) create a virtual environment, for example:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv 
    ```
2) Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate # Windows (cmd)
    source .venv/bin/activate # macOS / Linux 
    ```
3) Install the dependencies for this project:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
**Open the Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook in the default browser. Navigate to `/notebooks/price_prediction.ipynb` to open the Jupyter Notebook. To see the used data sets, check the `/data` folder.

## <font color="SlateBlue">Used Datasets</font>
This project is based on publicly available datasets from `Ember` and the `Bundesnetzagentur | SMARD.de`. Note that both SMARD datasets were each created by merging two separate CSV files: one covering the period from 2015 to October 2018, and another from October 2018 to 2025. This was necessary due to the introduction of the new DE-LU bidding zone in October 2018. However, **no changes were made to the raw data files** themselves.
